    "Three-dimensional inverted-pyramid radiator formed by a stack of progressively larger square plates from apex to base; linear polarization and a broadside main lobe with mid realized gain; exhibits ultra-wideband impedance behavior spanning L through W via geometric scaling.",
    "Stepped-square ‘stack of squares’ antenna with the smallest plate at the feed apex and larger squares toward the base, creating a tapered inverted pyramid; produces a broadside beam, stable linear pol, and ultra-wide fractional bandwidth.",
    "Inverted-pyramid radiator composed of multiple square tiers acting as a broadband tapered profile; linear polarization with a broadside pattern and moderate gain, suitable for ultra-wideband operation across many bands."
