    "Compact square patch microstrip antenna on a thin substrate; single-resonant response with mid gain and linear pol, providing ultra-narrow fractional bandwidth for precision channel operation.",
    "Square planar patch over a continuous ground plane, edge-fed topology; linear polarization and a broadside lobe with mid realized gain, intentionally narrow FBW by design.",
    "Microstrip-like square radiator—low profile and single layer—offering linear polarization, a directive broadside pattern, and mid gain; narrow fractional bandwidth with band usability scalable from L to W."
