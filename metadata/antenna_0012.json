    "Compact RTK helical antenna on a small circular reflector: an FPC copper strip wound with constant pitch to form a single helix, yielding circular polarization with a broadside boresight beam, narrow fractional bandwidth, and mid realized gain across UHF/L bands.",
    "Flexible-PCB helix mounted above a round ground/reflector and fed at the base; produces circularly polarized radiation with a stable broadside main lobe, narrowband behavior, and moderate gain for precision positioning.",
    "Cylindrical support carrying an FPC spiral backed by a circular dish; the single-helix geometry provides CP and a boresight beam while maintaining a narrow FBW suitable for RTK use in UHF/L."
