    "Planar patch microstrip antenna on a grounded dielectric slabâ€”single resonant radiator with circular polarization and a broadside main lobe; ultra-narrow fractional bandwidth and mid realized gain; scalable from L through W bands by geometric resizing.",
    "Square/rectangular patch over ground with a microstrip-like feed and CP realized by perturbations (e.g., corner truncations or slots); produces a stable broadside beam, mid gain, and characteristically ultra-narrow FBW.",
    "Low-profile patch radiator featuring circular polarization (RHCP/LHCP via feed phasing) and a broadside boresight pattern; single-layer copper layout with mid gain and very narrow fractional bandwidth for precision channels."
