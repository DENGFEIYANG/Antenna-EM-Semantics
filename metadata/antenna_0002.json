    "Substrate-integrated waveguide leaky-wave antenna with via-fence sidewalls and a single longitudinal slot array on the top copper; linear polarization, endfire/directive beam, medium fractional bandwidth; Ku-band-capable via scaling.",
    "Planar SIW slab fed by a microstrip-to-SIW transition, radiating through a row of staggered/tilted slots that leak energy along the guide; linear-pol, endfire scanning behavior with high directivity; usable in the Ku band.",
    "Compact SIW slot array: periodic vias form waveguide walls while the top metallization carries narrow slots with gradually varied length/spacing to control leakage; linear polarization, endfire main lobe, medium FBW."
