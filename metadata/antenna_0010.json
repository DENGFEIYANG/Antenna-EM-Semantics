    "Compact tag layout featuring a bent feed path and elongated trace; single-layer planar construction yields linear polarization with a dipole-like omni pattern; ultra-narrow fractional bandwidth and low gain, scalable to L/S/C by geometric resizing.",
    "Mask-style render of a microstrip-like bent-line RFID radiator; the thin conductive path sets the resonance while maintaining very narrow FBW; linear polarization, omnidirectional field distribution, and intentionally low gain for close-range reading.",
    "Printed bent-line tag antenna on dielectric: minimal thickness and planar copper trace; linear-polarized omnidirectional radiation with ultra-narrowband behavior and low gain; targeted at UHF but scalable toward higher bands up to C."
