    "Rectangular horn body with an inner ridge pair and SMA-flange transition; ultra-wideband behavior with strong aperture efficiency leads to a high-gain broadside lobe; designed for scalable multi-band operation.",
    "Compact double-ridge structure: a tight ridge gap near the throat that opens toward the mouth forming a wide flare; linear polarization and high gain with a boresight beam; suitable for L/S/C/X/Ku/K/Ka coverage.",
    "Metallic (PEC) double-ridged horn, coaxially excited, featuring tapered ridges that expand into a large rectangular mouth; exhibits ultra-wideband performance with a stable broadside main beam and linear polarization across many bands."
