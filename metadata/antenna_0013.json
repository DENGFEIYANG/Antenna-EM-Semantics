    "Mask-style patch layout on a thin substrate: microstrip feed excites two orthogonal modes in quadrature to yield circular polarization; broadside radiation with mid realized gain and ultra-narrowband behavior; usable across L/S/C/X/Ku/K/Ka/V/W via scaling.",
    "Compact microstrip patch above a continuous ground planeâ€”circularly polarized response with a clean broadside lobe; narrow FBW typical of patch antennas and moderate gain, suitable for tightly allocated bands.",
    "Single-feed CP patch design on dielectric, employing slight asymmetries to enforce quadrature modes; delivers a broadside main lobe, mid gain, and ultra-narrow fractional bandwidth, with band usability extendable from L to W."
