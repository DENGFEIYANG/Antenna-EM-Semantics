    "Square microstrip patch on a dielectric slab—single copper layer over a ground plane—yielding linear polarization, a broadside radiation pattern with mid realized gain, ultra-narrow fractional bandwidth, and a low-profile form factor.",
    "Planar square patch radiator with a microstrip-like feed; delivers a stable broadside main lobe and linear polarization with mid gain, exhibiting ultra-narrow FBW; scalable via geometric resizing across L/S/C/X/Ku/K/Ka/V/W bands.",
    "Mask-style square patch layout: simple square metallization above ground with a short feed trace; produces a clean broadside beam, linear polarization, and the characteristic narrowband behavior of patch antennas."
