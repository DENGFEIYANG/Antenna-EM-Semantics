    "Stacked square metallic elements arranged as an inverted pyramid above a support, fed at the apex; the gradual area expansion enables wide impedance coverage, yielding linear-pol broadside radiation with mid gain.",
    "3D tapered square-section antenna: discrete square steps emulate a continuous pyramid, delivering ultra-wideband match; radiates a broadside main lobe with linear polarization and moderate realized gain.",
    "Mask-style concept of an inverted-pyramid broadband radiator—multiple square plates increasing in size toward the base—providing linear polarization, a broadside beam, and ultra-wideband characteristics from L to W when scaled."
