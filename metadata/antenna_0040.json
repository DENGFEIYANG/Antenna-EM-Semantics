    "Mask-style Vivaldi layout: narrow input near a circular pad and a curved taper toward a wide mouth; high-gain endfire response, ultra-wideband impedance characteristics, and stable linear polarization over multiple bands.",
    "Single-substrate tapered-slot antenna with a continuously flared slot and circular input region; inherently ultra-wideband, producing linear polarization and a forward endfire beam with strong directivity.",
    "Exponential Vivaldi slot etched on a planar laminateâ€”long, smoothly widening aperture that favors broadband operation; generates a linear-polarized endfire beam and high realized gain, with band usability spanning S to W when scaled."
