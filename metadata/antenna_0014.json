    "Compact FPC helical antenna mounted above a small circular reflector dish; produces circular polarization with a broadside main lobe, ultra-narrow fractional bandwidth and mid realized gain, usable across UHF/L bands via scaling.",
    "Flexible printed-circuit helix wound on a slim former and backed by a round reflector; single-feed CP radiation with a broadside beam, exhibiting ultra-narrowband behavior and moderate gain.",
    "Reflector-backed FPC helix: several uniform turns starting from a base feed near the dish, delivering circular polarization and a broadside pattern; designed for ultra-narrow FBW with mid gain in UHF/L."
