    "UHF RFID tag antenna with a thin bent-line conductive trace on a microstrip-like board; linear polarization and a dipole-like omnidirectional pattern; ultra-narrow fractional bandwidth and low realized gain, scalable across UHF/L/S/C bands.",
    "Planar bent-line tag geometry—single-layer copper on dielectric—optimized near the chip pads; produces linear polarization with an omnidirectional response, showing ultra-narrow FBW and low gain, usable via scaling from UHF through C band.",
    "Meandered/bent conductor forming the tag radiator on a microstrip-style substrate; low-profile structure with linear pol and near-azimuthal coverage; ultra-narrowband characteristics and low realized gain suited for passive RFID operation."
