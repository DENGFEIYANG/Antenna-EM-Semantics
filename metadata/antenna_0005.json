    "Double-ridged horn with a rectangular flared aperture and a paired set of tapered ridges running from an SMA coax feed to the mouth; linear polarization set by the ridge orientation, ultra-wideband response, and a high-gain broadside beam scalable across L/S/C/X/Ku/K/Ka.",
    "Coax-fed PEC horn: two symmetric internal ridges guide energy through the flare to the aperture, yielding a boresight main lobe, linear polarization, ultra-wide fractional bandwidth, and high realized gain over multiple bands.",
    "Wideband ridged-horn geometry—exponential ridge profile and smooth flare—supports broadband matching and stable beam shape; produces a linear-polarized, high-directivity broadside pattern usable from L to Ka when scaled."
