    "Tapered-slot (Vivaldi) antenna on a microstrip-like board: an exponential flare from a narrow throat to a wide open aperture at the board edge, yielding a directive endfire beam with linear polarization and high gain; ultra-wideband behavior scalable from S to W bands.",
    "Planar Vivaldi geometry with a circular feed/throat that transitions smoothly into an exponential slot; single-layer copper pattern on dielectric; endfire radiation, linear polarization, and ultra-wide fractional bandwidth with strong effective aperture.",
    "Open-ended tapered-slot radiatorâ€”smooth exponential flare and long aperture length; microstrip-fed throat for broadband match; delivers linear polarization and a directive endfire main lobe, usable across S/C/X/Ku/K/Ka/V/W via scaling."
