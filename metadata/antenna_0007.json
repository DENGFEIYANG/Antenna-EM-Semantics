    "Seven-element LPDA composed of PEC dipole pairs whose lengths and spacings shrink by a constant ratio, producing an endfire beam toward the feed with stable matching across a very wide band.",
    "Planar LPDA concept: coplanar dipoles mounted on parallel booms, port at the shortest pair, resistive load at the longest; linear-pol, endfire/directive behavior and ultra-wideband impedance characteristics."
