    "Microstrip-like SIW radiator with closed via fences and a short slot chain near the guide axis; produces a directive endfire pattern with linear polarization; medium FBW and the impression of high gain; Ku-band usability through geometric scaling.",
    "Tapered SIW leaky radiator on a dielectric substrateâ€”slot apertures cut in the top face and grounded via rows on both sides; forward endfire beam with linear pol and high directivity; suitable for Ku-band use.",
    "Mask-style concept of an SIW leaky-wave emitter: rectangular substrate outline, dual via fences, and evenly spaced slots that leak power toward the open end; linear-pol, endfire pattern, medium fractional bandwidth, Ku-capable."
